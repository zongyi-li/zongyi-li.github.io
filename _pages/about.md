I am a second-year PhD student advised by [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima) 
in the [CMS department](href="http://cms.caltech.edu) at Caltech. 
I have a broad interest in machine learning, theoretical computer science, and applied math.
Recently, I have been working on developing deep learning methods for partial differential equations. 
I am fortunate to be supported by the Kortschak Scholars Program.

I was an undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis, 
double-majoring in computer science and mathematics with a minor in Jazz. 
I was privileged to be advised by [Brendan Juba](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~bjuba/) and [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/).
